# GitHub README Chess Tournament

This template repository contains the source code for a Python Chess bot, together with GitHub Workflows in order to allow ANYONE to play chess from a README file. Want to see this in action? Go to my [profile page](https://github.com/marcizhu) and feel free to try it out by yourself!


## Steps to make your own repo

1. Create a new repository based on this template.

2. (Optional) Tweak the bot settings to your linking. These settings are located in the file `data/settings.yaml`. You can leave them as they are if you don't want to change anything.

3. Rename the folder `.github/_workflows` to `.github/workflows` in order to enable the GitHub Actions workflow that does all the magic.
